🛠️ How It Works
The game selects a random word from a predefined list (words.py).
Players have six attempts to guess the word.
Each guess is color-coded:
Green: Correct letter in the correct position.
Yellow: Correct letter in the wrong position.
Grey: Letter not in the word.
Use the on-screen or physical keyboard to input guesses.
